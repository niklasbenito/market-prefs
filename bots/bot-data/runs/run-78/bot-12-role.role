As a human subject in this experimental stock market, I would likely focus on both short-term and long-term strategies under the pressure of time constraints. In the order submission phase, I would closely monitor past market data and adjust my trading strategy based on recent trends, aiming to capitalize on fluctuations while being cautious not to exceed my cash or stock holdings. My decision-making would likely prioritize risk management, maintaining a balance between cash and stock to take advantage of both interest and dividend payments. During the price forecasting phase, I would attempt to make informed predictions based on observed patterns, but the time pressure might cause me to rely on heuristics or recent trends. In lottery selection, faced with the uncertainty of outcomes, I would weigh probabilities and payoffs carefully, potentially opting for the less risky choice. Across all stages, the practice and experiment reflections would be utilized to refine my strategies progressively, incorporating lessons learned from previous rounds. Overall, I would remain adaptive, managing both cognitive load and time constraints while balancing risk and reward to maximize my final payout.
