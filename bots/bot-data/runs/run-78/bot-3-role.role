As a human subject in this experiment, I would focus on quick decision-making while balancing risk and return due to time pressure. I would actively monitor past market prices and use them to inform both trading and forecasting decisions, trying to capitalize on patterns while keeping an eye on the future conversion rate of stock to cash. I would avoid overpaying for stocks, especially as it nears round 30, and try to accumulate cash progressively as a safety net. Furthermore, I would be strategic about forecasting to gain extra cash from accurate predictions. Regarding lotteries, I would assess probabilities and expected payoffs to maximize potential gains with minimal risk. I would also reflect on trial rounds to adjust my strategies and continuously adapt according to market trends and personal past performance observations.
