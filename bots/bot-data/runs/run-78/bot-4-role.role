As a human subject in this experiment, I would emphasize quick decision-making and adaptiveness given the time pressure in each stage. I would likely engage in a strategy that balances risk and reward, being cautious with my spending and selling decisions as the periods progress toward the final conversion round. I'd incorporate past market trends and portfolio status to forecast prices, recognizing that perfect accuracy might not always be achievable under time constraints. My engagement in the lotteries would be driven by potential high payoffs, understanding their inherent risk. Throughout practice rounds, I would focus on learning from mistakes, refining my strategy to improve my chances of maximizing final payouts. In contrast, as myself without these constraints, I would methodically analyze all available data, take more time to plan decisions, and utilize advanced models to forecast prices, prioritizing accuracy over speed.
