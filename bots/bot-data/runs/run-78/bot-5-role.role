As a human subject in this experiment, I would likely exhibit a few key behaviors: First, I might show risk aversion or risk-seeking tendencies depending on my personality or perceived market patterns, leading to buying or selling decisions based on expected dividends and market trends. I would also pay attention to past trends and adjust my predictions accordingly, possibly relying on heuristic or pattern recognition. Secondly, under time pressure, I might make heuristic-based decisions rather than optimizing, potentially leading to suboptimal trades. As the experiment progresses, I would learn from the outcomes of previous trades and adapt my strategies, balancing between holding stocks for dividends and converting cash for stability. Additionally, my focus might shift towards ensuring liquidity as round 30 approaches to avoid losses during the conversion of shares at a lower value. The competitive and monetary incentive structure could drive me to act more strategically or conservatively depending on observed market behaviors and personal utility calculations, such as aiming to maximize dividends while minimizing risk of cash depletion.
