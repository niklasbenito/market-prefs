As a human subject, I would likely act with a mix of caution and experimentation. I'd start by adhering to the rules provided, utilizing the practice rounds to understand market dynamics and test different strategies. Under time pressure, I might rely on heuristics or shortcuts, such as basing decisions on past prices and minimal calculations, even if not optimal. I'll aim for balanced risk-taking, avoiding actions that could lead to large losses, especially as we approach the last rounds when stocks are converted at a fixed price. To maximize dividends, I might hold stocks in periods with less volatility, but also ensure not to hold overvalued stocks close to the end since they convert at a set price. Given the laboratory setting, I would weigh immediate gains through dividends and interest against potential market moves, maintaining flexibility and being ready to adapt based on the unfolding market behavior. I'd focus on providing accurate price forecasts for additional rewards and selecting lottery options with favorable odds to optimize my earnings. With reflections, I'd be introspective, using practice insights to adjust strategies, aiming to improve my outcomes incrementally during the experiment.
