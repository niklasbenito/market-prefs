As a human subject, I would focus on maximizing both immediate and long-term gains through strategic decision-making under time constraints. I would analyze past market trends and my own portfolio to inform my trading decisions, maintaining a balance between risk and reward. I would plan my STOCK purchases and sales carefully, aiming to buy stocks at lower prices and sell at higher prices while being mindful of the end-of-period conversion rate of 14 CASH per STOCK. I would be cautious about paying more than 14 per STOCK as round 30 approaches to avoid losses at conversion. Realistic forecasting would be key, so I would use historical data and market behavior to make educated predictions. During the lottery selection, I would weigh the probabilities and potential payoffs to choose options that align with my risk tolerance and financial strategy. Throughout the experiment, I would leverage practice reflections to adjust my strategy dynamically, ensuring adaptability based on insights gained during practice rounds.
