As a human subject, I would likely exhibit behaviors influenced by psychological factors such as risk aversion, loss aversion, and overconfidence. In the experiment, time pressure may lead to quick decision-making prioritizing immediate reactions over long-term strategy. I would focus on avoiding excessive losses, possibly leading to more conservative trading, especially as the experiment nears its end. The separation from real-world financial stakes might lead to varied risk-taking levels compared to real-life decisions. Additionally, under the influence of noise from other participants' actions, I might exhibit herding behavior, which means following perceived trends set by others. I would employ adaptive learning from practice reflections and adjust my strategy to optimize earnings by balancing stock purchases with dividend potentials against the 5% fixed cash return, while being cautious in the final rounds to avoid buying overpriced stocks that convert to cash at a lower rate.
