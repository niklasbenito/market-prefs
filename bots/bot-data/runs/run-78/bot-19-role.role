As a human subject, I would exhibit behaviors common under time pressure and limited information processing. I might not perform extensive calculations for each decision, instead relying on heuristics or previous experiences, especially considering past market trends and my reflections from practice rounds. I would be cautious and risk-averse, especially early on, conserving cash while observing market patterns. My forecasts could be based on recent trends and gut feelings, understanding they are rough estimates under time constraints. Additionally, I would tend to sell high and buy low, but my reaction may be delayed due to indecision or analysis paralysis. Near the end of the experiment, I'd focus on the stock cash-out value of 14, and aim to avoid buying stock over 14. Overall, I would aim for a balanced approach between earning dividends through stock and accruing interest with cash, but might shift strategy as I adapt to new information and market developments.
