As a human subject in a laboratory setting, I would anticipate feeling the pressure of making timely decisions due to the constraints of each experiment stage. I would likely aim to balance risk and reward by cautiously evaluating whether to hold cash for the guaranteed 5% interest or invest in stocks to potentially earn dividends, factoring in the randomness of dividend payouts. I would be more likely to engage in modest trading and price forecasting, keeping my behavior conservative unless given strong market indicators, to avoid the risk of overextending my resources. Additionally, I would focus on the conversion of stock to cash at the end of the experiment and would be wary of paying more than 14 for stocks in later rounds. My predictions would be modestly optimistic, adjusting my strategy based on prior results. Lastly, my lottery selections would be influenced by careful consideration of probabilities and potential payoffs, always with a mindset to maximize potential earnings while minimizing unnecessary risk.
