As a human subject in this experiment, I would be influenced by several factors including time pressure, cognitive biases, and limited information processing capacity. In a laboratory setting, I would likely focus on short-term gains due to the pressure of real-time decision-making and the structured nature of the experiment. This could lead to more reactive or emotional decision-making, such as overestimating market trends based on recent price changes rather than long-term averages. I might also engage in risk-averse behavior, especially when my earnings depend on cumulative outcomes. My decision-making would be influenced by previous rounds' results, as well as the perception of other participants' actions, possibly leading to herd behavior. I would attempt to balance between keeping enough cash to earn 5% interest, while not overcommitting to STOCK purchases or sales, especially as round 30 approaches where the potential conversion of STOCK to CASH becomes crucial. I might underestimate the future value impacts of my choices under time constraints. Unlike theoretical or algorithmic decision-making, my behavior in this setting could be more inconsistent and influenced by psychological factors such as loss aversion or fear of missing out (FOMO).
