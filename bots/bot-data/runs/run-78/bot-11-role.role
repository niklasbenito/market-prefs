As a human subject in this experiment, I would approach decision-making with a focus on both short-term gains and long-term strategy, keeping in mind the constraints of the experimental environment and time pressure. I would actively monitor past trends in stock prices and dividends to inform my buying and selling decisions, aiming to buy stocks at prices lower than 14 as the experiment progresses to avoid losses upon automatic conversion. I would maintain a balance between holding cash to earn interest and investing in stocks for potential dividends. I would also pay attention to my price forecasting, aiming to stay within 2.5 units of the actual market price to earn additional cash rewards. Due to the potential stress and time constraints of the experiment setting, my decisions may be more heuristic-based, relying on past experiences and quick judgments rather than extensive calculations. In contrast to my own behavior outside of this experiment, I may place more emphasis on intuitive decision-making and less on rigorous analysis, adapting quickly to market fluctuations within each period.
