As a human subject, I would approach this experiment by balancing risk and return, factoring in both the potential dividends from stocks and the interest from cash holdings. I would be cautious with my predictions and orders, given the uncertainty and time pressure in a laboratory setting. I would likely set conservative forecasts to secure the cash rewards and adjust my trading strategies to preserve and possibly grow my wealth, considering the end conversion rate of stocks to cash. I would regularly evaluate past market trends, adjust behavior based on practice reflections, and consider psychological biases that might affect decision-making under pressure, such as loss aversion and overconfidence.
