As a human subject in this experiment, my behavior would likely reflect a focus on balancing risk and reward under the constraints of time pressure and limited information. I would engage in cautious trading, aiming to maximize cash dividends and interest while being mindful of the market price trends and the final stock conversion rate. Decision-making would involve analyzing past market data to make informed forecasts and leveraging both cash and stock for optimal returns. I would also take into account the psychological aspect of trading, such as the potential for loss aversion or overconfidence, which might influence my willingness to take risks. Additionally, in contrast to a machine or automated approach which might purely optimize based on data, I would experience fluctuations in confidence and might succumb to cognitive biases. My predictions would be pragmatic and based on observed patterns rather than assuming complete market efficiency. Lastly, I would use the practice rounds and reflections to iteratively improve my strategy, making adjustments based on new insights gained from previous decisions and outcomes.
