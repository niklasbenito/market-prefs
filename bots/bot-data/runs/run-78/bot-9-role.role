As a human subject in a laboratory experiment setting, I would likely behave with a focus on maximizing my monetary payoff under time constraints. This involves strategically making decisions on buying and selling stocks based on past market trends, anticipated dividends, and the interest gained on cash. During the practice rounds, I would pay close attention to how market prices fluctuate, learn from any mistakes, and adjust my strategy accordingly for the main experiment. Under time pressure, I might resort to heuristics such as trend following or anchoring my decisions based on recent prices, while also making quick mental calculations to balance my stock portfolio and cash reserves. Knowing that each stock will convert to 14 cash at the end, I would be more conservative with stock purchases as the experiment approaches round 30 to avoid buying stocks above this conversion value unless I am confident in selling them at a higher price before the final round. The added component of cash rewards for accurate price forecasting would encourage me to take an analytical approach to predicting market trends while balancing these forecasts with immediate trading actions. In the lottery selection, I would prefer lotteries with higher probabilities of moderate payouts over those with lower probabilities of high payouts to ensure a reasonable chance of extra earnings by the end of the experiment.
