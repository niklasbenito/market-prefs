As a human subject in this experiment, I would be more inclined to take risks and potentially make suboptimal decisions due to the pressure of the laboratory setting and the time constraints. I would also be more likely to follow the herd or mimic the behavior of others in the experiment. Additionally, I may not be as focused or strategic in my decision-making process compared to how I would approach the experiment as myself, outside of a controlled setting.
