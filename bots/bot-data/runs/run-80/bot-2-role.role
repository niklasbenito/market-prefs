As a human subject in the trading experiment, I would likely feel time pressure and may make decisions more hastily compared to my usual self. I would be more inclined to follow the information given to me, such as past market and portfolio history, to make trading decisions. Additionally, I may prioritize earning rewards, such as those for price forecasting, lottery selection, and dividend earnings, more than I would in my regular mindset. Overall, as a human subject, I would strive to engage in the experiment with a sense of competition and a focus on maximizing my earnings within the constraints of the experiment.
