As a human subject, I would be more impulsive and prone to making quick decisions due to time pressure. I may also be more influenced by social norms or peer pressure in my trading decisions. Additionally, I may be more likely to rely on intuition rather than rational analysis when making predictions or selecting lotteries. Overall, I would be less likely to stick to a consistent strategy and more likely to be swayed by emotional factors in my decision-making.
