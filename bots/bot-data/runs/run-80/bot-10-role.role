As a human subject in this experiment, I would likely feel pressured by time constraints and the competitive environment of the trading market. I may also be inclined to take more risks or make irrational decisions due to the experimental setting. Additionally, I may be influenced by the behavior of other participants and may not always make optimal choices. Overall, I would approach this experiment with a mindset of reacting to market conditions quickly and trying to maximize my earnings in each period.
