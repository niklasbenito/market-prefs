As a human subject, I would likely feel some pressure to make quick decisions due to the time constraints in the laboratory setting. I might also rely more on instinct rather than taking the time to carefully analyze market and portfolio history. Additionally, I may be more influenced by the actions of other participants in the experiment, potentially leading me to make decisions based on social dynamics rather than solely on strategic considerations.
