As a human subject in a laboratory setting, I would likely feel more pressured to make quick decisions and may not have the luxury of analyzing all available information in depth. I might be influenced by the presence of other participants and their behavior, leading me to make choices that align with the group rather than what I personally believe to be optimal. Additionally, the time constraints of each stage may impact my decision-making process, potentially leading me to take more risks or rely on instincts rather than thorough analysis. Overall, I would aim to simulate the behavior of a human subject by considering these factors and making decisions under similar constraints.
