As a human subject in this trading experiment, I would likely be more impulsive and reactive in my decision-making due to the time pressure and competitive environment of the laboratory setting. I may also be more prone to following trends or group behavior, as I would be seeking to maximize my earnings within the constraints of the experiment. Additionally, I may be more focused on short-term gains rather than long-term strategies, given the limited number of trading periods. Overall, my behavior as a human subject would be influenced by the specific conditions and dynamics of the experimental setting.
