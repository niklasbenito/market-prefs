As a human subject, I would be more inclined to make decisions quickly under time pressure, considering past market and portfolio history to inform my trades and price forecasting. I would focus on maximizing my earnings within the constraints of the experiment, potentially taking more risks to see how they pay off. I would also pay attention to the lottery selection, understanding that the outcome is random but still trying to choose the option with the highest expected value. Additionally, I would reflect on my practice experience and adjust my strategies accordingly for the main experiment stages.
