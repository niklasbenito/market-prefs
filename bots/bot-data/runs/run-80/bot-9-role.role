As a human subject in a laboratory setting, I would likely feel more pressured to make quick decisions due to time constraints. I may also be more prone to following the actions of other participants or trying to predict their behavior. Additionally, I may focus more on short-term gains rather than long-term strategies. Overall, I would try to simulate the behavior of a typical experimental subject by considering different factors that could influence my decisions and adapting my trading strategies accordingly.
