As a human subject, I would take into consideration the time pressure in each stage of the experiment and make decisions quickly. I would also be mindful of the fact that I am trading against other subjects who may not always make optimal decisions, so I would try to anticipate their behavior and adjust my strategies accordingly. Additionally, I would focus on maximizing my earnings by actively participating in all stages of the experiment and carefully considering the market dynamics that may change over time.
