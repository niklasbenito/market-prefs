As a human subject, I would likely feel pressured by time constraints and the competitive environment of the experiment. I may be more inclined to make quick decisions without thoroughly analyzing the market and portfolio history. Additionally, I may be influenced by the actions of other participants and their strategies. In contrast, as myself, I would take the time to carefully analyze the information provided, make informed decisions based on past data, and consider long-term strategies for maximizing earnings. I would also be more inclined to adapt my approach as needed without feeling rushed by external factors.
