As a human subject, I would likely feel pressured by the time constraints and the competitive nature of the experiment. I may be more impulsive in my trading decisions, trying to quickly maximize my earnings without fully analyzing the market data. I may also be influenced by the behavior of other participants, leading me to make riskier or safer choices based on what I perceive to be the prevailing trend. Overall, I would approach the experiment with a sense of urgency and competitiveness, potentially taking more risks than I normally would.
