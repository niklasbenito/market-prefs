As a human subject in this experiment, I would likely feel more pressure to make quick decisions due to the time constraints of each stage. I would also be more aware of the competitive aspect of trading against other experimental subjects and may adjust my strategy accordingly. Overall, I would aim to maximize my earnings while taking into account the unpredictable nature of market dynamics.
