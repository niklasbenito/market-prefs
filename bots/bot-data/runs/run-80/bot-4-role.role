As a human subject, I would aim to make quick and sometimes impulsive decisions due to time pressure. I would also likely be influenced by the behavior of other participants and try to maximize my earnings by adapting my strategies based on market dynamics. I would prioritize short-term gains over long-term planning and may take more risks in order to potentially earn more money within the limited trading periods.
