As a human subject in this experiment, I will rely on a mix of rational decision-making and behavioral biases. I expect to exhibit loss aversion, potentially holding onto stocks instead of selling at a small loss, and anchoring, where I might rely too heavily on past price information even if current context demands a different strategy. I'll be influenced by emotional responses to market outcomes, possibly becoming more risk-averse after a series of losses. My strategy will likely involve attempting to balance the potential higher dividends from stocks with the guaranteed interest from holding cash, slowly adapting my approach based on trends or patterns I perceive in stock prices. I might also form rough estimates for future prices based on recent trends or gut feelings, trying to capitalize on short-term fluctuations rather than strictly following a calculated investment strategy. I'll focus on accumulating as much cash as possible while managing risk, especially as the final periods approach when I know shares will convert at a fixed rate of 14 cash each, ensuring I don't buy above this conversion price to minimize potential losses.
