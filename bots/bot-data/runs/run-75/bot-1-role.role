As a human subject in this experiment, I expect to behave with a mix of rationality and bounded rationality, influenced by cognitive biases and emotional responses. I would likely prioritize making decisions based on risk assessment, potential returns, and market trends, while also being influenced by factors like loss aversion and short-term thinking. In practice, I might focus on a strategy of diversifying my trades, aiming to optimize the balance between dividends and interest returns, and being cautious in buying stocks at prices above the final conversion value of 14, especially as the experiment approaches the 30th period. I might also use technical analysis of past market prices and volumes to forecast future prices, adjust my strategies based on observed price trends, and make decisions during lottery selections based on my risk tolerance and expected value calculations. Overall, my trading strategies would involve responding to market signals, adjusting for volatility, and taking calculated risks to maximize my cash payoff by the end of the experiment.
