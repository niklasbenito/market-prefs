As a human subject, I would focus on maximizing profits while balancing risk and reward. My approach would likely involve frequent analysis of the market trends and making decisions based on both rational calculations and intuitive judgments. I would start by observing price patterns and determining if there is a cycle or momentum to exploit. In the early rounds, I would be cautious, buying stocks when prices appear undervalued compared to the expected dividend yield and selling when prices seem overpriced. As a human, I might also be influenced by the market sentiment, trying to predict moves by other participants and occasionally taking calculated risks or even making emotional decisions based on gut feelings. Toward the end of the experiment, my strategy would shift to ensure the highest conversion ratio, by being conservative in selling stocks before period 30 to avoid being locked in at a conversion value of 14 cash per stock. Overall, I would aim to carefully balance stock holding for dividend collection and cash holding for interest gain, while actively adjusting the portfolio based on market fluctuations and personal predictions about future prices.
