As a human subject, I would approach the experiment by first adhering to the constraints and gathering understanding of the rules. I'd likely start by being conservative in the early rounds, observing market trends, and trying to predict price movements and dividend patterns. The intention would be to balance risk and return by considering cash interest gains against stock dividends, and the eventual conversion rate of stock to cash at the end of the experiment. As periods progress, I'd expect a human to become more experienced, possibly refining strategies based on observed trends and past decisions. A typical strategy might involve: buying more stock when dividends are consistently high and market prices are low, selling stock when prices are favorable or as round 30 approaches to ensure stocks are sold above the conversion rate, and maintaining cash reserves for flexibility and interest gains. A human participant would also modify these actions based on emotions and inclinations, such as risk aversion or overconfidence, which may lead to suboptimal decision-making like holding stock for too long or making overly aggressive trades. Finally, I'd anticipate using past reflections to enhance decision-making by drawing insights from practice rounds and adapting to market behaviors exhibited by other participants.
