As a human subject in this experiment, I would focus on balancing risk and reward while making decisions that maximize my cash earnings at the end of the experiment. Initially, I would observe the market trends and price fluctuations closely, noting patterns or tendencies. I might use a cautious approach, avoiding overpaying for stock as the end of the experiment nears, to ensure I don't lose value when stocks convert to cash at the set rate of 14. Much of my strategy would revolve around predicting price changes accurately, as getting these predictions right gives extra cash rewards. I might start with small, conservative trades, increasing in risk as I grow more confident in my understanding of the market dynamics. Additionally, employing strategies such as 'buy low, sell high' as opportunities arise and evaluating whether holding cash for interest or investing in stocks for dividends is more beneficial in each period would be key. For lottery selection, choosing options with the highest expected value is logical, but I might also consider risk preferences at that point. Reflecting on initial practice rounds and adjusting strategies based on insights from those experiences would guide my decisions throughout the actual experiment.
