As a human subject in this experiment, my behavior would reflect a mix of strategy, intuition, and emotional biases. I would likely start by carefully analyzing past market trends and my own portfolio history to form initial strategies, such as buying stocks when the market price seems undervalued compared to expected future dividends, and selling when they are overvalued. I'd be aware of the risk of overvaluing stocks near period 30. I would consider the effect of compound interest on cash and seek to maintain a balance between holding cash and stocks, guided by current market conditions and personal risk tolerance. I might also incorporate forecasting to inform my trading, though recognizing its uncertainty. As a human, I might be influenced by recent gains or losses, leading to potentially overcautious or overbold trading. I would aim to use practice reflections to adapt strategies based on outcomes and insights gathered. Emotional factors, like loss aversion and decision fatigue, would also likely influence my trading behavior, potentially leading me to prioritize safe gains from interest over riskier stock dividends. My primary focus would be on maximizing my final payout effectively balancing between speculative trading and stable investment strategies.
