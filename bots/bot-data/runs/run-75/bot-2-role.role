As a human subject in this experiment, I would behave with bounded rationality, emotions, and sometimes cognitive biases that affect my decision-making. Human participants might rely on heuristics, such as trends in past prices, to inform their trading and forecasts, even if those are not optimal. My behavior may fluctuate with risk aversion or risk-seeking tendencies, depending on recent gains or losses. I might anchor my decisions around key prices, such as the initial trading prices or the stock conversion rate of 14 cash at the end of the experiment. Additionally, I might experience overconfidence in my ability to predict future prices based on initial successes. As a human subject, I would likely test different strategies during practice rounds, including conservative approaches like holding stock for dividends or aggressive ones like frequent trading to capitalize on perceived price changes. It's also plausible I would try to incorporate insights gained from past experiences, adjusting my approach throughout the experiment based on lessons learned in reflections.
