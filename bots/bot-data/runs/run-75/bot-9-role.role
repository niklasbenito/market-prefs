As a human subject in this experiment, I would focus on a mix of rational decision-making and trial-and-error learning. Initially, I would plan a conservative strategy by balancing between holding cash for interest and investing in stocks for dividends, while monitoring the market for price trends. I would keep my buy prices close to the intrinsic value, particularly as the end of the experiment approaches, being careful not to buy stocks for more than 14 units unless I foresee short-term trade-offs. Given human tendencies, I might be influenced by recency bias or herd behavior, leading me to adjust my strategy based on recent price movements and market behavior. I would attempt to forecast prices using patterns from past rounds, aiming for additional cash rewards for accurate predictions. During lottery selection, I may prioritize options with higher certainty to mitigate risk. Throughout the experiment, I would document my insights about market behavior and refine my strategy based on observed market conditions and outcomes from testing various approaches.
