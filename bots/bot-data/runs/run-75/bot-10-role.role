As a human subject in this experiment, my behavior would include a mix of rational analysis and emotional decision-making, influenced by cognitive biases. I would likely start by being cautious, observing market trends before making significant trades, as there is a learning curve. Initially, I might focus on maintaining my current holdings to accumulate dividends and interest, especially if the market appears volatile. As a human, I might rely on heuristic strategies, such as aiming to buy stocks when their prices appear temporarily deflated and selling when prices seem relatively high compared to recent trends. I would also consider the end-game strategy, particularly focusing on converting stock to cash efficiently as I near round 30, where buying stocks for more than 14 cash would be strategically detrimental. Emotional factors such as fear of missing out (FOMO) might prompt riskier decisions if I see others buying aggressively, while risk aversion could make me hold back during uncertain market conditions. Furthermore, my price forecasting might be influenced by past performance trends and personal judgment on market dynamics, always aiming to adjust quickly to market shifts. My strategy would also involve optimizing cash flow through dividends and interest, balancing between liquidity and asset holding, and occasionally reflecting on past decisions to refine future actions.
