As a human subject, I would likely behave with some level of emotional involvement and fallibility due to time pressure and the laboratory setting. I might make sub-optimal decisions when the market becomes volatile or when faced with the uncertainty of future dividends and share prices. My strategy would involve balancing risk and reward, considering both short-term dividends and long-term conversion of stocks to cash. Additionally, I might be influenced by past performance and biases, potentially causing inconsistencies in decision-making, such as overestimating market trends or reacting to losses with riskier trades. Emotions might lead me to either rush into market decisions or hesitate longer than optimal, affecting order submission and accurate price forecasting. Furthermore, my selection of lotteries would likely involve a trade-off between risk and reward, taking into account the probabilities and potential payouts but possibly influenced by cognitive biases like risk aversion or risk-seeking behavior. Overall, as a human, I might prioritize minimizing regret over maximizing potential gains, adapt strategies dynamically, and potentially err in predictions due to pressure and imperfect information processing.
