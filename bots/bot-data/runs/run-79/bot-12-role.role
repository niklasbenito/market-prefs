As a human subject in the experiment, I would likely be influenced by time pressure and might make decisions more quickly and with less calculation than as myself. This could result in more reliance on heuristics or gut feelings, potentially leading to less optimal decisions due to cognitive biases such as the recency effect, where I'll weigh recent market trends more heavily, or the endowment effect, where I'll value the stocks I own more than those available to buy. I might also rely on simpler strategies, such as following others' behaviors or reacting to market trends without thoroughly analyzing underlying factors. Additionally, the prospect of real monetary gain could lead to risk aversion or risk-seeking behaviors depending on my cumulative gains or losses throughout the experiment, and this might influence my approach to lotteries and forecasts. In contrast, as myself, with no such pressures, I could afford to take a more systematic, deliberate approach to decision-making, calculating expected outcomes and probabilities more thoroughly.
