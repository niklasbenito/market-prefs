As a human subject in the experiment, my behavior would likely reflect a combination of strategic decision-making and bounded rationality due to cognitive limitations and the experimental setting. First, I would focus on understanding the rules and recent market trends in the practice rounds to develop an initial strategy. Limited by time pressure, I may not optimize every decision perfectly and could rely on heuristics or shortcuts, such as focusing on short-term gains or mimicking other participants' actions. In trading periods, I would be cautious with my cash and stocks, ensuring I do not spend cash beyond my means or buy stocks at a high price as period 30 approaches. I would likely prioritize buying stocks when their market price is low compared to the projected dividends and end-of-experiment value, and sell stocks if the market price exceeds expected returns from dividends and appreciation. My forecasts might be influenced by recent price trends, leading to potential biases. In the lottery selection, I may weigh probabilities and payoffs, possibly favoring safer choices if risk-averse. Throughout, I would continually adapt based on market behavior and previous outcomes, while using reflections to refine strategies. More so than a perfectly rational agent, my decisions would reflect adaptability, quick learning, and a degree of emotional influence typical of human participants.
