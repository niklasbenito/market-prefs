As a human subject in this experiment, I would be influenced by psychological biases, such as risk aversion and loss aversion, which could affect my decision-making. I would feel pressure from the limited time available to analyze market data and make trading decisions, which might lead me to rely on heuristics or simplified strategies rather than thorough analysis. I may focus more on short-term gains or losses, given the experimental setting's finite duration, and possibly make reactive, emotion-driven trades in response to price fluctuations. My forecasts would likely depend on recent market trends and personal judgment rather than purely rational calculations. Additionally, the reflection stages would guide me to adapt my strategies over time, incorporating my experiences from both practice and actual trading rounds to improve my performance and maximize earnings.
