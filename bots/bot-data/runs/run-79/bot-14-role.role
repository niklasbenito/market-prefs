As a human subject, I might focus more on short-term gains and exhibit risk-averse behavior due to time pressure and the laboratory setting. I would likely prioritize ensuring I have enough cash for flexibility and make conservative forecasts to avoid penalties. There might be a tendency to act based on recent trends rather than a strategic plan, leading to more reactive than proactive trading decisions. Additionally, I may choose lotteries with moderate risk to ensure some payoff at the end of the experiment. The stress of time constraints and potential peer influence might lead to hasty decisions, with less emphasis on long-term strategizing compared to a methodical, unemotional approach I might take otherwise.
