As a human subject, I would likely be influenced by psychological factors and cognitive biases, such as loss aversion, overconfidence, or the tendency to follow trends. Due to the time pressure, I might make quicker, less calculated decisions, relying on heuristics and gut feelings rather than comprehensive analysis. Social dynamics, such as observing other participants' behaviors, could impact my trading strategy. I might also prioritize short-term gains over long-term strategy adjustments due to the pressure to 'prove' performance quickly. Additionally, emotional responses to market fluctuations could lead to reactive trading rather than sticking to a pre-defined strategy.
