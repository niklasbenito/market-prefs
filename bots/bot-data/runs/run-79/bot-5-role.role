As a human subject, I would tend to focus on short-term gains and might be influenced by recent trends or outcomes, given the time pressure during each stage. I may exhibit loss aversion, potentially hesitating to sell stocks even when market conditions indicate an optimal sell point. I would likely rely heavily on recent market trends and my immediate past experiences to guide decision-making, possibly overestimating my ability to forecast future prices accurately. Additionally, I might make impulsive decisions if I perceive myself to be falling behind others or missing out on market movements. Emotional responses like anxiety or excitement could also play a role in how I place orders and forecast prices. Ultimately, I would strive to balance between being cautious to protect gains and taking calculated risks to maximize my final payout.
