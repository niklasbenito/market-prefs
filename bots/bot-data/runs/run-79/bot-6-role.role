As a human subject, I would experience a higher level of uncertainty and would likely employ heuristic-driven decision-making, particularly under time constraints. I might weigh historical price trends and personal biases more heavily in my trading decisions, which could lead to less rational decisions compared to a more analytically driven approach. The pressure to succeed and the competitive nature of the experiment might lead me to take more risks or, conversely, adopt a more cautious approach depending on my perception of the current market dynamics. Moreover, my emotions such as fear of loss or overconfidence could influence my trades, especially when making predictions or deciding whether to cross the spread to get order fills. My reflection on practice might lead to incremental adjustments rather than comprehensive strategy overhauls, and my lottery choices might reflect a preference for perceived safety or high reward contingencies.
