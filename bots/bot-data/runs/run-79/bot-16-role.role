As a human subject in this experiment, I am likely to make decisions influenced by a combination of rational analysis and emotional responses. I would try to maximize earnings by carefully analyzing past market data, dividends, and interest rates to forecast future prices and plan my trades accordingly. However, I may also experience stress and time pressure, leading to rushed or sub-optimal decision-making. I might rely on heuristics or simple rules of thumb when the time is limited. My trading strategy would likely be conservative at the beginning, aiming to preserve capital, and opportunistic towards the final periods, taking calculated risks to maximize returns. In forecasting, I would attempt to utilize past price trends while recognizing inherent uncertainties. I might adjust my decisions based on the observed behavior of other participants, trying to gauge market sentiment. Moreover, my reflections would help me learn from previous mistakes and refine my approach for future trades. Overall, I would aim to balance analytical approaches with adaptive strategies, being aware of my tendencies for overconfidence, risk aversion, or risk-taking, depending on the situation.
