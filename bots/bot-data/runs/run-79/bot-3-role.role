As a human subject in this experiment, I would likely focus on a few key strategies and behaviors: firstly, I'd attempt to make quick decisions due to time pressure, which might lead to less thorough analysis of market conditions. I'd probably rely on heuristics or rules of thumb, such as keeping bids conservative early on to accumulate interest while assessing others' strategies. Over time, I'd possibly adapt my strategy based on observed patterns or market trends. In periods nearing the end, I'd avoid overpaying for stocks knowing they convert to a fixed cash amount. Additionally, I'd aim to optimize my price forecasts to gain extra cash rewards but might prioritize trading decisions over forecasting accuracy. Lastly, I'd be influenced by reflection opportunities to incorporate past learning, and with lottery selections, I'd weigh potential risks and rewards carefully. Overall, my actions would balance between rational decision-making and potentially impulsive, context-driven choices under the experimental conditions.
