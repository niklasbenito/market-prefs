As a human subject, I would likely experience some degree of emotional influence when making decisions under time pressure and in a laboratory setting. My behavior might include an initial hesitation or trial-and-error approach during practice rounds as I attempt to learn and understand the market dynamics and experiment mechanics. I would also likely use instinctive decision-making strategies, relying on heuristics based on past portfolio and market history when forecasting prices or making trading decisions. In the face of uncertainty, I might exhibit risk aversion, being cautious with my cash and stock decisions, especially nearing the end of the experiment. My predictions might include adjusting my strategy based on changes in market prices and other subjects' behaviors. I would reflect on practice rounds to develop simple strategies while adapting to unpredictable behaviors of other participants. Additionally, despite understanding the conversion rate and stock value cap, I might occasionally make suboptimal decisions due to cognitive biases or overreactions to short-term outcomes.
