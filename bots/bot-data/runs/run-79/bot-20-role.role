As a human subject in this experiment, I would likely focus on understanding the immediate implications of each decision due to time pressure, which may lead to reliance on heuristics or simplified strategies. I might exhibit risk aversion, especially under uncertainty, and pay more attention to recent trends rather than long-term strategies. Iâ€™d also be prone to emotional responses during price fluctuations, possibly affecting my trading decisions. In contrast, if I were not constrained by human traits, I would optimize my decisions based solely on rational calculations, fully exploiting historical data patterns without being influenced by emotions or time constraints.
