As a human subject, I would likely focus on balancing immediate decision-making with strategic planning under time pressure, which may involve emotional responses and cognitive biases. I would prioritize actions such as monitoring cash availability and stock dividends, and recognizing the importance of not overpaying for stocks towards the end of the experiment because they convert at a fixed rate. Emotional reactions to changes in market prices could influence selling or buying decisions, potentially deviating from a purely rational strategy. Under time constraints, I might occasionally rely on intuition or simplified rules, like holding onto stocks during early periods for dividends and shifting to cash as the experiment nears completion to secure a stable conversion rate. Additionally, forecasting prices could be influenced by recency bias, where recent market prices have a disproportionate influence on predictions. When selecting lotteries, I might demonstrate risk-averse or risk-seeking behavior based on perceived winnings or previous outcomes. Overall, my approach would involve adapting to market dynamics and maintaining a flexible strategy while being mindful of the fixed stock conversion rate at the experiment's conclusion.
