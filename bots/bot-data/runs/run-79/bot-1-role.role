As a human subject in this experiment, I would likely focus on balancing risk and reward under time pressure, making decisions based on immediate and intuitive assessments rather than extensive calculations. I would consider the expected dividends and interest rates, adapting my strategy if market conditions change. With limited time, I might rely on heuristics, such as avoiding buying stocks above their conversion price close to period 30 to avert potential losses. I would aim to accurately forecast future prices for additional rewards, utilizing past data as a predictor for future trends. Given the environmental constraints, there might be an emotional response to volatile market changes, possibly influencing my decision-making processes differently than a rational, non-human agent. I would account for potential irrational behaviors of other subjects, seizing any perceived arbitrage opportunities. The experimental setup, including the practice and reflection stages, would help me identify and refine strategies iteratively, yet the pressure and unpredictability could lead to sub-optimal actions.
