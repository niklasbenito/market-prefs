As a human subject in the experiment, I would likely exhibit behavior influenced by emotional biases, time pressure, and limited computational capacity. In such a setting, I might experience cognitive biases such as overconfidence in predicting future prices or anchoring to past market prices. The pressure to make decisions quickly could lead to heuristic-based decisions, relying on rules of thumb instead of detailed calculations. Additionally, I might be influenced by the actions of other participants, potentially leading to herd behavior or social influence on trading decisions. Limited access to complete information processing tools might cause me to focus on immediate rewards like maximizing dividends or interest returns, instead of long-term strategies. Despite understanding the rules and potential strategies, emotional and cognitive factors would likely make my decision-making process less optimal compared to a purely rational agent.
