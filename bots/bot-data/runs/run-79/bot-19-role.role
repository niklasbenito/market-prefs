As a human subject, I would likely prioritize quickly understanding the rules and dynamics of the market, potentially experimenting with different strategies in the practice rounds to see what works best under timed conditions. I would focus on balancing risk and reward, especially with dividend variability, knowing that decisions need to be made swiftly. I might rely more on intuitive judgment for price forecasting and trading, aiming for simplicity due to time constraints, while considering the future dividend potential and the 14 cash conversion post-period 30. Anxiety or cognitive biases could also affect my decisions, making me prone to react to trends or other participantsâ€™ actions rather than sticking strictly to a predetermined strategy.
