As a human subject in this experiment, I would experience the following tendencies: I might be influenced by cognitive biases such as overconfidence and loss aversion, leading me to make riskier decisions or overly cautious moves. There would be a temptation to rely on heuristic shortcuts due to the pressure of time constraints during each trading stage, potentially causing me to overlook important details or miss optimal trading opportunities. As I trade against other humans, I might be swayed by social dynamics, such as trends or panic selling, where I might follow the crowd instead of sticking to my own strategy. There could also be a tendency towards anchoring on previous market prices, affecting my price forecasting accuracy. I would engage in speculative trading based on gut feelings or recent market trends without fully rational analysis. Reflection stages may be approached with bias towards rationalizing past mistakes or outcomes. All these human-like behaviors might prevent me from aligning trading decisions solely with a logic-based analysis of the market data available.
