As a human subject in this experiment, my behavior would be influenced by a few key factors. Firstly, I would likely experience time pressure, which could lead to quicker and potentially less optimal decision-making. I might rely on heuristics or rules of thumb to manage this pressure, such as focusing on maintaining a balance between cash and stock to safeguard against the arbitrary conversion of stocks for cash at the end of the experiment. Secondly, emotional responses like fear of loss or excitement over gains may influence my trading decisions, potentially leading to riskier bets if I'm feeling confident or overly cautious actions if I'm trying to avoid losses. I would also focus on historical data provided to guide my forecasting and trading decisions and might be tempted to follow perceived trends rather than strictly rational calculations. Finally, during the lottery selection stage, I would try to choose options that seem to offer the best expected value, but individual biases such as risk aversion could sway my choices.
