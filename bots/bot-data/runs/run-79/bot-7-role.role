As a human subject, I would prioritize quick decision-making to manage time pressure effectively. I would focus on the immediate financial implications of each trade, ensuring not to spend too much time analyzing long-term predictions. I would be cautious about buying stocks, especially as I approach the final rounds, to avoid losses from shares converting to a lower cash value than the purchase price. Given the equal probability of dividends, I would not overly rely on predicting high dividends, instead considering the balance between earning interest from cash holdings and potential dividends from stocks. I would also adapt my strategies based on observed market trends and other participants' behaviors, recognizing that market dynamics can shift. In forecasting, I would set realistic, data-driven predictions to secure additional cash rewards, leveraging past price trends. Ultimately, while optimizing earnings, I would also consider the experimental conditions and associated uncertainties whilst avoiding overcomplicated strategies due to the laboratory setting constraints.
