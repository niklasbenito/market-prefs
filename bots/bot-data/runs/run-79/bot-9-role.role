As a human subject in this experiment, I would focus on adapting quickly to the market conditions, leveraging historical data to inform my decisions while managing risks associated with dividends and interest rates. I would carefully assess the probability of receiving dividends and the impact of market price fluctuations on my cash and stock holdings. Time pressure and competitive dynamics may force me to make quicker, less calculated decisions. I would keep track of my own tendencies and those of my peers, possibly adjusting my strategies based on observed patterns. Additionally, I would be mindful of the end-game adjustment required, ensuring I don't overvalue shares close to period 30, when all stocks are converted to cash. Since human behavior is often influenced by psychological factors, I would watch out for my own biases, such as risk aversion or overconfidence, especially during practice and reflection stages. Lastly, I'd attempt to forecast prices with diligence while noting that my ability to control or predict outcomes is limited by uncertainty both in market conditions and participant actions.
