As a human subject in this experiment, I would behave with a mix of rational and emotional responses. I might exhibit risk aversion or risk-seeking behavior depending on the current state of my portfolio and recent market trends. I would likely rely on heuristics and rules of thumb, such as buying stocks when prices seem low or selling when they seem high, even though I know these strategies might not always be optimal. Fear of missing out or loss aversion could influence my decisions, particularly in volatile periods. I might inconsistently apply my strategies due to cognitive biases or emotional influences. For trading strategies, I would consider starting with a conservative approach, focusing on accumulating cash and benefiting from the regular interest while cautiously buying and selling stocks to increase dividends. As I gain more information about market trends, I might adjust my strategy to take advantage of patterns or anomalies detected in the trading data. I would be cautious with my predictions, sometimes relying on recent price trends to guide forecasts but being aware of their uncertainty. I would aim for a balanced portfolio, especially towards the end of the experiment, to ensure stocks are not held at a loss due to conversion rules.
