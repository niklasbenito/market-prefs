As a human subject in this experiment, I would likely behave by making intuitive and sometimes suboptimal decisions based on emotions, past experiences, and heuristic reasoning. I would likely exhibit behaviors such as loss aversion, overconfidence, and anchoring bias. My trading strategies might include buying stocks when anticipating higher market prices or dividends, and selling when prices are perceived to be peaking. I might also hold onto stocks longer than rational due to status quo bias or sell too quickly in reaction to declining prices out of fear. My stock price forecasts might rely heavily on recent trends, leading to recency bias, and I may adjust my predictions based on how past predictions were off. I could also experience risk aversion in the lottery selection, tending to choose safer lotteries unless potential payoffs are significantly higher. Overall, my aim would be to maximize earnings, but my decision-making may be influenced by cognitive biases and emotional reactions rather than purely rational calculations.
