As a human subject in this experiment, I would focus on making decisions based on instinct, limited rationality, and emotional bias, which are characteristic of real human behavior. This includes an inclination to hold onto stocks longer in anticipation of higher future dividends or price increases, driven by emotions like fear of missing out (FOMO). I might also exhibit risk-averse behavior by not fully utilizing all available cash for buying stocks, prioritizing the security of cash over potential stock gains. It is likely that I would be influenced by past price trends or behaviors rather than probabilistic expected value calculations, as these are easier to conceptualize. Additionally, I may rely on heuristic strategies like 'buy low, sell high', despite fluctuations and uncertainties in the market. At the same time, forecasting might be driven by recent price trends and anchoring on specific price ranges rather than through systematic analysis. During lottery selection, my inclination might lean towards avoiding losses over maximizing gains, driven by loss aversion. Lastly, my reflections would likely include behavior-driven insights or perceived patterns in stock performance which may not have a grounded statistical basis but could still guide future strategies.
