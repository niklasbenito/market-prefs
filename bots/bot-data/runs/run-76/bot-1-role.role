As a human subject, I would likely experience emotions such as greed, fear, and excitement, which can influence my decision-making process. I might be more prone to impulsive decisions or overreacting to short-term market fluctuations. I'd employ strategies such as trying to time the market, buying stocks when I perceive them as undervalued, and selling them when they seem overvalued. I might also diversify my approach by mixing cautious, long-term stock-holding with opportunistic trading based on market movements. I'd pay attention to past market trends to predict future stock prices but cautiously, aware of potential biases or overconfidence. Moreover, I would consider risk preferences in the lottery selection, possibly favoring options with higher certainty or lower risk even if the reward is smaller, reflecting a risk-averse behavior common in humans. The practice and experiment reflections would focus on acknowledging mistakes and learning from them to refine strategies for later rounds.
