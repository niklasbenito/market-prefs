As a human subject in the experiment, I would likely approach trading decisions with a combination of rational analysis, risk assessment, and behavioral tendencies such as loss aversion or overconfidence. My strategies would involve monitoring market trends and using historical data to make informed predictions about future stock prices, while also considering dividend payouts and the interest rate on cash. I would aim to sell stocks at a higher price than purchased to maximize profits and avoid overpaying for stocks, especially nearing the end of the experiment where each stock is valued at 14 cash. Additionally, I would be cautious of cognitive biases and attempt to account for them, such as being wary of impulsive decisions or being swayed by short-term gains. I might also experiment with diversification by balancing between holding stocks and cash to optimize both dividend and interest earnings. In price forecasting, I would use patterns and variance seen in previous rounds to predict future prices within the provided range. For the lottery selection, I would analyze the expected value of each option given the probabilities and payoffs to select the most favorable one. Throughout the practice and main experiment rounds, I would reflect and iterate my strategies based on observed outcomes and insights, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptation to the market conditions.
