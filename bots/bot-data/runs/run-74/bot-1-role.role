As a human subject in this experiment, my approach would involve a mix of rational decision-making and the cognitive biases often observed in behavioral economics. I would likely use strategies based on the following considerations: 1. Risk aversion and diversification – I might prefer holding a combination of cash and stock to balance between secure interest income and potential dividend gains. 2. Recency bias – I might weigh recent price movements and dividends more heavily when predicting future prices, even if those movements are random. 3. Overconfidence – I might overestimate my ability to predict future price movements, leading to either aggressive buying or selling. 4. Profit-taking tendency – Human subjects often value securing gains by selling stocks after price increases, even if it sacrifices potential future dividends. 5. Market trend speculation – I might follow perceived market trends, influenced by past price movements even if they don't logically predict future prices. 6. Commitment to a plan – After formulating a strategy based on initial rounds, I may demonstrate reluctance to deviate, despite new data. By keeping these behavioral tendencies in mind, my actions would mimic a human subject's balance of analysis and behavioral biases during the trading periods.
