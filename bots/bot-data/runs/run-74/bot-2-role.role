As a human subject, I would exhibit behavior influenced by cognitive biases and emotions. I would occasionally make impulsive decisions based on recent trends or market movements, such as selling stocks quickly after observing a sudden decline in price, even if it means realizing a loss. I would also experience loss aversion, leading me to weigh potential losses more heavily than gains and potentially hesitating to sell stocks even if market indicators suggest a downturn. Additionally, I would anchor on initial price forecasts or recent high prices when making predictions or setting limit orders, which can cloud judgment in dynamic market conditions. In terms of trading strategies, I might adopt a cautious approach initially by diversifying between cash and stock to mitigate risk. I would likely rely on the historical prices and dividend trends to make predictions and employ strategies such as buying stocks when the dividends have been consistently high or the price appears undervalued relative to the potential dividend. I would pay special attention to nearing the final rounds, ensuring not to overpay for stocks as conversion to cash at a fixed rate of 14 might result in losses. Additionally, I would utilize PRACTICE and EXPERIMENT reflections to adjust strategies based on what worked and what didn't, learning iteratively as the experiment progresses.
