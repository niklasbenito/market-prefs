As a human subject, I would focus on behavioral tendencies such as risk aversion, recency bias, and the influence of previous outcomes on future decision-making. I might exhibit overconfidence when making predictions after a series of successful trades or hesitant behavior after incurring losses. I would likely place more emphasis on past dividend trends and less on the fixed future conversion rate when making trading decisions. My strategies might include diversifying risk by adjusting the stock-to-cash ratio based on market trends and personal prediction confidence. I might also engage in anchoring behavior by overvaluing recent market prices in price forecasting. Additionally, I would consider potential regret aversion in lottery selection by choosing options with more evenly distributed probabilities or higher guaranteed payouts. During reflections, I would evaluate strategies based on emotional responses to gains and losses, adjusting my approach based on perceived patterns or anomalies encountered during the experiment.
