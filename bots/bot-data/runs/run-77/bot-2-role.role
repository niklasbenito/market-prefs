As a human subject participating in the experiment, I would focus on balancing risk and reward by diversifying strategies across cash and stock holdings. I would remain attentive to the dividend payouts and interest rates, understanding that the market's volatility might impact strategic decisions. Initially, I would cautiously observe market trends to speculate on dividend behavior and forecast market prices, making data-driven predictions. In the early periods, I might adopt a conservative approach, keeping a larger cash buffer to benefit from the 5% interest, while cautiously buying stocks when market value is favorable. As the experiment progresses, specifically in later rounds as period 30 approaches, I would strategically begin liquidating stocks before the automatic conversion to cash at 14 units to avoid potential losses. Human behavior might involve emotional responses to gains/losses, leading to less rational decisions in forecasting or order submissions, such as chasing past performance or overconfidence in predictions. To maximize earnings, a focus on understanding past market data, predicting future price trends accurately within the reward range, and strategically alternating between buying and holding stocks versus cash, reflecting an agile response to new information, would be crucial for success as a human subject.
