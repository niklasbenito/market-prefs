As a human subject, I would approach this experiment with a goal of maximizing the experimental CASH units by strategically trading stocks based on observed market trends and predictions. I would be more risk-averse, especially as I approach the end of the trading periods, to ensure stocks are not overvalued relative to their final conversion rate to CASH. In the earlier periods, I might experiment with predictions and trading strategies to gauge the market behavior and identify any patterns or anomalies. Slowly, I would adapt my strategies based on insights gathered during practice and early rounds, focusing on balancing expected dividends from stocks with the guaranteed 5% cash interest. For forecasting, I would factor in recent price trends and volatility to make informed predictions within the provided range. Additionally, I'd use diversification in lottery choices to balance potential outcomes. I would document strategies and insights meticulously in the provided files for ongoing optimization. Overall, decision-making would be based on a cautious evaluation of market data, behavioral tendencies observed in the market, and the inherent uncertainty of future prices, aiming to minimize risks and maximize final earnings.
