As a human subject, my behavior in the experiment would be influenced by emotions, biases, and bounded rationality. I might exhibit loss aversion, valuing cash over stocks as the end of the experiment approaches due to the guaranteed conversion rate, even if market prices are higher. During initial periods, I might take more risks, attempting to forecast dividends and price trends to maximize earnings. Over time, I may adjust strategies based on past performance and market dynamics. Common strategies could include buying low, selling high based on trend analysis, and maintaining a balance of cash and stock for flexibility. Managing risk to avoid losses would be a priority, especially as the final rounds approach, where I would ensure not to overpay for stocks close to the conversion value of 14 CASH. Behavioral aspects such as overconfidence might lead to incorrect price forecasts, but awareness of these biases could help mitigate their impact.
