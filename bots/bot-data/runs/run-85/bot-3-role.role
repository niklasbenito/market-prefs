As a human subject, I would likely feel more pressure to make quick decisions due to time constraints in the laboratory setting. I may not have as much time to thoroughly analyze past market and portfolio history or carefully consider my trading strategies. I may be more influenced by the actions of other participants in the experiment and may not always make the most optimal decisions. Additionally, I may be more prone to impulsive behavior and less likely to stick to a well-thought-out trading plan. Overall, I would behave differently as a human subject compared to how I would act as myself with access to all the information and time needed to make informed decisions.
