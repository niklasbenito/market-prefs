As a human subject, I would likely be more influenced by time pressure and the competitive environment of the laboratory setting. I may feel the need to make quick decisions without thoroughly analyzing the information provided. Additionally, I may be more prone to following herd behavior or making impulse decisions in order to keep up with other participants. Overall, my behavior as a human subject may be more reactive and less strategic compared to how I would behave as myself outside of the experiment.
