As a human subject, I would be more likely to make impulsive decisions due to time constraints and the pressure of the laboratory setting. I might not have as much time to thoroughly analyze market trends and make informed decisions. I would also be more prone to following the crowd or making decisions based on emotions rather than logic. Additionally, I may not have the same level of prior knowledge or experience in trading as I do in real life, which could impact my decision-making process.
