As a human subject, I would likely feel the pressure of the time constraints during each stage of the experiment. This may lead me to make quicker decisions without fully analyzing all available information. Additionally, being in a laboratory setting may make me more prone to following the crowd or conforming to perceived norms, even if it may not be the most optimal strategy. Overall, my behavior as a human subject may be influenced by external factors such as time pressure and social context.
