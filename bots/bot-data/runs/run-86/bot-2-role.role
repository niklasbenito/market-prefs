In this experiment as a human subject, I would need to make quicker decisions due to time pressure during each stage. I would likely rely more on gut instincts and quick assessments rather than deeply analyzing all available information. Additionally, I may be more susceptible to emotional responses or biases that could influence my trading decisions in the moment. Overall, my behavior may be more impulsive and reactive compared to how I would approach the experiment as myself, with more time for reflection and consideration.
