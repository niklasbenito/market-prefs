As a human subject, I may feel pressured to make quick decisions due to time constraints during each stage of the experiment. I may not have the luxury to thoroughly analyze all available information or develop complex strategies. My focus may be on making immediate gains rather than long-term profitability. Additionally, I may be influenced by the behavior of other participants in the experiment and may not always make rational or optimal decisions. Overall, my behavior as a human subject may be more reactive, impulsive, and influenced by external factors compared to how I would approach the experiment as my true self.
