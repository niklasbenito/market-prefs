As a human subject, I would likely be more impulsive in my trading decisions due to time pressure and the experimental setting. I may not have the luxury of thorough analysis and could be influenced by the actions of other participants. I would need to make quick decisions based on the information available, which may lead to more reactive rather than strategic choices.
