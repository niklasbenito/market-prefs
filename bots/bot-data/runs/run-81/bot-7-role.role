As a human subject, I would likely feel pressured to make quick decisions due to the time constraints of the experiment stages. I might not have the luxury of thoroughly analyzing all the information provided before submitting my orders. Additionally, I may be influenced by the actions of other participants and be more inclined to follow the crowd rather than stick to a well-thought-out strategy. Overall, my decision-making process might be more impulsive and less strategic compared to how I would behave as myself with more time and freedom to carefully consider all factors.
