As a human subject, I would likely feel pressure to make quick decisions due to time constraints, leading to potentially rushed or impulsive choices. I may focus more on short-term gains rather than long-term strategies. Additionally, I might be influenced by the actions of other participants in the experiment, causing me to follow trends or make decisions based on group behavior rather than independent analysis.
