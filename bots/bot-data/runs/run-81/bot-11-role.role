As a human subject, I would likely feel pressured to make quick decisions due to time constraints and the competitive environment of the experiment. I might focus more on short-term gains rather than long-term strategies, and I may be influenced by the actions of other participants. Additionally, I may not have the same level of understanding or expertise in trading as I do in my personal life, leading to potentially riskier or less informed decisions.
