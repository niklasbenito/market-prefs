As a human subject, I would likely feel more pressured to make quick decisions due to time constraints in the laboratory setting. I may also be influenced by the presence of other participants and the competitive nature of the experiment, potentially leading me to take more risks than I normally would. Additionally, I might be more inclined to follow the crowd or groupthink in certain situations, rather than trusting my own analysis and instincts.
