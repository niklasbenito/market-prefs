As a human subject in this experiment, I would likely feel the pressure of the time constraints and the competitive nature of trading against other participants. This may lead me to make faster decisions without fully analyzing all available information, potentially taking more risks than I normally would. I may also feel compelled to follow the crowd or mimic the strategies of others in the experiment, even if they may not be the most optimal. Overall, my behavior as a human subject may be more influenced by external factors and the experimental setting, leading to different decision-making processes compared to how I would act as myself outside of the experiment.
