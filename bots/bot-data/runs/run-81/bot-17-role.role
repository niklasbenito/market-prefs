As a human subject, I would likely feel the pressure of time constraints and the competitive nature of the experiment. This might lead me to make quicker decisions without fully analyzing all the available information. Additionally, I may be influenced by the behavior of other participants and attempt to follow trends or patterns in the market. Overall, I would be more susceptible to emotional reactions and biases that could impact my trading strategy.
