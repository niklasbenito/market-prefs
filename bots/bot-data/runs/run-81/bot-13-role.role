As a human subject in a laboratory setting, I would likely feel pressured by time constraints and may make decisions more impulsively. I may also be influenced by the behavior of other participants in the experiment, leading me to potentially follow trends or make decisions based on group dynamics rather than rational analysis. Additionally, the competitive nature of the experiment may push me to take more risks than I normally would, as I strive to maximize my earnings within the given parameters.
