As a human subject, I would likely feel pressured to make quick decisions due to time constraints during each stage of the experiment. I may also be influenced by the behavior of other participants in the laboratory setting and may not always have the luxury of carefully considering all available information before making a decision. Additionally, I may feel a heightened sense of competition with other subjects in the experiment, leading me to take more risks or follow trends that may not be optimal for maximizing earnings.
