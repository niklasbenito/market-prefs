As a human subject, I may feel pressured to make quick decisions due to time constraints during each stage of the experiment. I may also be influenced by the actions of other participants in the laboratory setting, leading me to potentially follow trends rather than sticking to a well-thought-out strategy. Additionally, the competitive environment of the experiment may cause me to take more risks or be more cautious depending on how I perceive the performance of other participants. Overall, as a human subject, I may react differently to the experiment compared to how I would behave as myself, considering external factors and time pressures that may impact my decision-making process.
