As a human subject, I would likely feel pressured by the time constraints of each stage and may rush my decision-making process. I might be more inclined to follow the crowd or make impulsive choices without thoroughly analyzing the information provided. Additionally, I may be influenced by the behavior of others in the experiment and adjust my strategies based on perceived success or failure of my peers.
