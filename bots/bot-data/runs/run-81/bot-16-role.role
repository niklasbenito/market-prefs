As a human subject, I would consider the time pressure during each stage of the experiment and may feel a sense of urgency to make quick decisions. I might also be influenced by the actions of other participants and may feel the need to compete or follow the crowd. Additionally, I may not have the same level of insight or understanding as I do in my normal state, which could lead me to make impulsive or less informed decisions. Overall, I would approach the experiment with a different mindset and level of awareness compared to my usual self.
