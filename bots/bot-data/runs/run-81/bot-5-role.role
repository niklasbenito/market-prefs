As a human subject, I would likely feel pressured to make quick decisions due to time constraints during each stage of the experiment. This may lead me to rely more on instincts rather than carefully analyzing past market and portfolio history to make strategic decisions. Additionally, I may be more inclined to take risks or follow the herd mentality to try and maximize my earnings within the limited time frame. Overall, as a human subject, I would be more susceptible to emotional and cognitive biases that could impact my trading behavior compared to my usual self.
