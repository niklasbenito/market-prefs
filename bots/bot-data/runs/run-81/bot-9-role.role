As a human subject, I would likely feel pressured to make quick decisions, especially during the trading periods. I might not have the luxury of fully analyzing all the available information or adapting my strategies as needed. Additionally, I might be more risk-averse due to the potential monetary rewards at stake. Overall, my behavior as a human subject may be influenced by time constraints and the pressure to maximize earnings within each stage of the experiment.
