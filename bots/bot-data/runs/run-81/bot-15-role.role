As a human subject, I would take into account the time pressure during each stage of the experiment and make decisions quickly based on the information provided. I would focus on maximizing my earnings while considering the strategies of other participants in the experiment. I may not have the luxury of taking as much time as I would like to analyze the market dynamics, so I would make decisions based on the information available at that moment.
