As a human subject, I would likely feel more pressure to make quick decisions during each stage of the experiment. I would prioritize following instructions and maximizing my earnings within the time constraints given. I may not have as much time to reflect on past market and portfolio history or adjust my strategies as carefully as I would if I were acting as myself. Overall, I would approach the experiment with a focus on efficiency and following the guidelines provided to me.
