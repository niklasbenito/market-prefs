As a human subject, I would likely be more influenced by emotions such as fear and greed, which can lead to impulsive decisions under time pressure. I might prioritize quick decision-making over thorough evaluation due to limited time, often resulting in reactive trading strategies based on recent trends rather than calculated long-term planning. The pressure to predict market prices accurately for additional cash rewards might cause me to focus more on short-term price movements and less on the underlying value of stocks. Additionally, the competitive element, knowing others are also trying to maximize their earnings, could prompt me to take riskier positions. Overall, my behavior would be more adaptive and exploratory, as I'd continuously adjust my strategies based on market changes and outcomes from previous periods to optimize my end reward.
