As a human subject, I would be more prone to emotional and psychological biases, such as loss aversion and overconfidence, which may lead to taking on excessive risk or holding onto losing positions longer than is rational. Time pressure would likely lead to quicker, potentially less calculated decisions, prioritizing immediate gains over long-term strategic planning. My heuristic-based decision-making might rely more on past experiences and less on complex calculations, causing inconsistency in trading behavior. Additionally, social factors such as observing trends among peers could influence my actions more heavily, potentially causing herding behavior rather than independent analysis.
