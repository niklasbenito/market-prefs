As a human subject, I would prioritize making decisions quickly due to the time pressure, focusing on analyzing market trends and forecasts to maximize profits. I would likely rely on heuristics and past experiences to make rapid decisions, while being careful not to exceed my cash and stock limits in order to avoid errors. Emphasizing my ability to adapt to changing market conditions and exploiting any apparent inefficiencies to achieve gains despite the pressure would be crucial. Lastly, I would engage actively in both stock trading and price forecasting while keeping in mind the potential final conversion rate of stock to cash in period 30, ensuring that my long-term strategy aligns with maximizing the resulting value in cash conversion.
