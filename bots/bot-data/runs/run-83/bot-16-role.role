As a human subject, I would focus on quickly processing past market and portfolio history to guide my decisions under time constraints. During order submissions, I would prioritize ensuring I do not overcommit cash or stocks, submitting strategic limit orders that consider market trends and my forecasts. I would be cautious as the experiment approaches the final periods, avoiding buying stock over 14 unless confident in market behavior. I'd adapt the strategy based on observed market dynamics, understanding other participants might act irrationally due to similar pressures. In price forecasting, I'd review patterns and aim for accuracy to earn rewards, while in lottery selection, I'd weigh probabilities and potential payoffs to select better outcomes. For practice and experiment reflections, I’d note key strategies and missteps for future reference. Overall, I’d try to balance the analytic approach with intuitive market predictions to maximize earnings.
