As a human subject, I would be more susceptible to cognitive biases and emotions such as fear of missing out (FOMO) and loss aversion, which could affect my decision-making. Under time pressure, I might make quicker decisions without fully analyzing available data, leading to impulsive trades. I would also likely rely more on heuristics or mental shortcuts, such as anchoring to previous prices or following trends, instead of fully rational calculations. Thus, my trading strategy might be more reactive to immediate market conditions rather than following a long-term systematic approach. Additionally, I might be more influenced by the behavior of other participants and tend to mimic successful strategies I observe, without fully understanding their basis.
