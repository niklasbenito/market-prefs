As a human subject in a laboratory setting, I would likely respond more emotionally to market fluctuations and time pressure, leading to potentially impulsive decisions and possible overreactions. I would also focus on short-term gains to ensure tangible outcomes within the limited time frame, rather than maintaining a long-term strategic approach. Recognizing the impact of group behavior and being cautious of possible herd mentality would be crucial. I might also rely more on intuition when predicting prices or selecting lotteries, especially under stress, rather than performing detailed analyses.
