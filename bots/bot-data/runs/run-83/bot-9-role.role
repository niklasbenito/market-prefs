As a human subject, I would focus on quickly processing the information available, such as past market data and current portfolio status, while keeping the experiment's time constraints in mind. I would use heuristics to make decisions, such as selling stock if the last market price is significantly above 14 as the experiment progresses, and ensuring not to buy stock for more than 14 towards the end to avoid losses at conversion time. I'd also focus on learning from practice periods to develop a strategy that balances cash holdings for the 5% interest while capitalizing on dividend yields, adapting in response to market dynamics each round. Additionally, during the lottery selections and forecasting stages, I'd use probabilistic judgment and historical data to inform my choices within the time limits.
