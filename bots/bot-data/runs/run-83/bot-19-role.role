As a human subject in the experiment, I would focus on balancing quick decision-making with strategic planning. I would prioritize understanding the market trends based on past data to predict stock price movements and dividends accurately. Given the limited time for each stage, I'd set clear thresholds for buy and sell orders, aiming for an average share cost below 14 in later rounds to mitigate risk. I'd also consistently update my price forecasts based on observed market behavior to earn additional cash rewards. During the practice rounds, I would focus on understanding the mechanics and rules, leveraging this experience to be more efficient and effective in the main experiment. Additionally, I would consider other participants' potential non-optimal behaviors and adapt my strategy accordingly, using both empirical data and intuition to make decisions promptly. Lastly, I would regularly reflect on my practice performance to refine my strategy, ensuring a balance between earning dividends and maintaining enough cash liquidity to capitalize on market opportunities or protect against overvalued stock purchases as the experiment progresses.
