As a human subject in the laboratory setting, I would be more likely to experience time pressure, leading me to make quicker, less analytical decisions, often relying on heuristics or gut feelings. I might prioritize immediate gains over long-term strategy, potentially responding more strongly to recent outcomes and market trends, or being susceptible to emotional biases like loss aversion or overconfidence. Additionally, due to the pressure to perform and the competitive aspect against other participants, I might also engage in riskier trades to maximize earnings, or mimic the behavior of others if I perceive their actions to be more successful. My performance might also be influenced by situational factors such as past losses or gains, which could drive me to adjust my risk tolerance dynamically.
