As a human subject in this experiment, I would need to adapt quickly to the dynamic environment and make decisions under time pressure during each stage. I would focus on building intuition about market trends using past data and my experiences in practice rounds. I would be cautious about overbidding for stock as we approach the 30th period to avoid losses due to the automatic conversion to 14 CASH per stock. I would use concise strategies to forecast prices accurately to earn additional cash rewards, and I would pay close attention to maximizing cash and dividend returns each period. I would also prioritize observing and anticipating other participants' behaviors to make strategic offers, recognizing that they, too, are optimizing their decisions under similar constraints.
