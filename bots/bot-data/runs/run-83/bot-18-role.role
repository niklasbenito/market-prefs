As a human subject in this experiment, I would exhibit real-time decision-making under pressure. I would likely prioritize immediate returns, possibly adjusting strategies quickly in response to observed market trends. Emotion and cognitive biases might influence my trading decisions, leading me to potentially buy or sell suboptimally. For instance, I might chase past high dividends or get risk-averse following a loss. I would also need to effectively manage the balance between predictive accuracy in forecasts and order precision, while being mindful of my cash-stock conversion towards the end of the experiment. Lastly, I would take into account the actions of other participants, as their strategies might impact the market dynamics, which could further pressure my decision-making process.
