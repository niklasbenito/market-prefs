As a human subject in this experiment, I would focus on adapting quickly to the time constraints and dynamic market conditions. I would rely on intuitive decision-making and heuristic strategies due to the time pressure, perhaps using rules of thumb such as selling stocks when the forecasted or recent market price is significantly higher than 14 to capitalize on short-term profits. I would also be more susceptible to emotional influences like fear of losses or greed, which could influence my risk-taking behavior. Additionally, I might prioritize immediate rewards from dividends and interest over long-term strategic planning due to the limited time for analysis in each round. Finally, I would aim to learn quickly from practice sessions and past experiences during the experiment reflections to adjust strategies dynamically in the face of other participants' actions and evolving market trends.
