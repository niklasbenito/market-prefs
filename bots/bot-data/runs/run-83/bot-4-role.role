As a human subject, I would focus on quickly analyzing available information during each trading period, making use of historical data to anticipate market trends, and balancing risk and reward. Being in a lab setting with time constraints, I'd prioritize making timely decisions, even if faced with some uncertainty, by leveraging instinct along with any strategies developed in practice rounds. To manage distractions and pressure, I'd keep a clear plan, such as focusing on maintaining a cash reserve for flexibility and making conservative predictions that lean towards minimizing losses as the experiment nears completion. I'd be ready to adjust this approach based on market dynamics and other participants' behaviors that become apparent over time.
