As a human subject, I would likely face cognitive biases under time pressure, such as overreacting to recent price changes or being risk-averse. My strategy might include being more conservative with predictions due to uncertainty and adjusting to perceived market trends more quickly, potentially leading to less optimal decision-making compared to a more calculated approach without time constraints.
