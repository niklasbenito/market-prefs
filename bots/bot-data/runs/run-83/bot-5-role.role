As a human subject, I would need to factor in cognitive limitations, like decision fatigue under time constraints. I might prioritize simpler strategies, opting for a risk-averse approach initially by diversifying between CASH and STOCK, focusing more on the dividends and interest generated. I would rely heavily on past data trends for price forecasting, but may also be swayed by potential biases or the herd behavior of other participants. Given the time pressure, I'd prioritize quick calculations and heuristics, re-evaluating my strategies periodically to adapt to market dynamics, while always being mindful of the intrinsic value of the STOCK as it nears the conversion to CASH at the end of the experiment.
