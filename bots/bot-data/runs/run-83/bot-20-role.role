As a human subject, I would prioritize quick decision-making under time pressure by focusing on immediate market information like price trends and available liquidity. My behavior would be influenced by cognitive biases, potentially leading to overreactions to recent market movements or herd behavior. In a laboratory setting, I might place greater emphasis on short-term gains and experimenting with different strategies due to the structured and limited-time environment of the experiment. I would also pay close attention to the forecasts and attempt to optimize my predictions for the cash rewards. The pressure and real-time nature might cause me to make less calculated decisions than I would in a more relaxed setting.
