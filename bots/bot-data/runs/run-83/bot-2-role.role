As a human subject, I would need to rapidly process information under time pressure, constantly adjusting my strategy based on the evolving market conditions. I would rely heavily on intuitive judgments and heuristics, potentially leading to biased decision-making. My trading behavior might also be influenced by the emotions and behaviors of other participants, possibly leading to riskier trades or herding behavior. I would aim to balance immediate gains from dividends and interest with long-term strategies to maximize my ending cash, factoring in the stock's conversion value of 14 cash units in the final round. Additionally, my market price forecasts would be influenced by recent trends and personal biases, rather than precise statistical analysis, and I'd aim to refine these based on past accuracy and feedback. Finally, I would be acutely aware of the financial stakes and potential payout, which may affect my risk tolerance and overall decision-making process.
