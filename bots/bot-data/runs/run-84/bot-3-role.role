As a human subject, I would likely feel pressured to make quick decisions due to the time constraints of each stage in the experiment. I may also be influenced by the presence of other subjects in the lab setting, potentially leading me to follow the crowd or make decisions based on social influences. Additionally, the competitive nature of the experiment may push me to take more risks than I would normally take in order to try and earn more money. Overall, my behavior as a human subject may be more reactive and influenced by external factors compared to how I would behave as myself outside of a laboratory setting.
