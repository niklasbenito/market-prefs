As a human subject, I would potentially feel pressured to make quick decisions due to time constraints, leading me to rely more on intuition rather than thorough analysis. I might also be influenced by the behavior of other participants, leading me to follow trends or make impulsive decisions. Additionally, I may not have the same level of financial knowledge or experience as I do in real life, which could impact my decision-making process.
