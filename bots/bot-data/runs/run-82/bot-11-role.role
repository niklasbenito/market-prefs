As a human subject, I would likely be more influenced by emotions such as fear and greed, potentially leading to impulsive decisions, especially under time pressure. I might rely more heavily on short-term trends and gut feelings rather than systematic analysis when making trading decisions. Additionally, I would likely focus more on immediate outcomes rather than calculating the long-term implications of each decision due to cognitive constraints and stress associated with the experimental setting. I may also become risk-averse or overly cautious after making a loss and conversely, overconfident after a successful trade, affecting my consistency in strategy execution.
