As a human subject in this experiment, I would focus on making quick decisions due to time constraints, leveraging intuition and heuristics to respond to the market dynamics rather than over-analyzing. I would aim to balance between holding cash for the interest and stocks for dividends, paying close attention to price trends and signals to optimize buying and selling strategies. Risk management would be crucial, especially near the end when stock values convert to cash at a fixed rate. I would prioritize making approximate price forecasts quickly to earn additional rewards and select lotteries with the best expected value based on probabilities and payouts. Reflecting on practice rounds would involve evaluating strategies' effectiveness to refine my approach during real trading periods. Overall, my behavior would be adaptive, using past learnings and observations to inform future decisions, while remaining agile in the face of potential market volatility and other participants' actions.
