As a human subject, I would focus on effectively managing both time and information under pressure. I would prioritize quickly analyzing past market and portfolio history to forecast prices accurately and make informed trading decisions. My strategy would involve maintaining a balance between retaining cash for interest and investing in stocks for dividends, while remaining adaptable to market shifts. Near the end of the experiment, I would avoid overpaying for stocks above the conversion value of 14 CASH and focus on liquidating assets when appropriate to optimize my final cash holdings. Additionally, I would strive to diversify my risk by carefully selecting lotteries and using reflections to enhance my decision-making skills based on previous rounds.
