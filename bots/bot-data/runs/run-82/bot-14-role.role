As a human subject, I would prioritize quick decision-making due to time pressure, relying heavily on heuristics and gut feelings rather than extensive analysis. I might be influenced by recent price trends, peer behavior, and emotional responses to gains or losses. I would likely take some risks in the lottery selection, aiming to balance potential high rewards with lower probabilities. During order submission, I might quickly adjust my strategies based on recent market conditions and forecasts, keeping an eye on short-term gains while being cautious about stock prices as we approach round 30 to avoid losses from automatic conversions below 14 cash. Practice reflections would focus on adjustments needed for the main experiment based on observed outcomes, and experiment reflections would concentrate on learned strategies and whether my predictions and decisions met my risk-reward expectations.
