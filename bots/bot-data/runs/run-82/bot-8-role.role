As a human subject, my approach involves making quick yet strategic decisions under time pressure. In the practice rounds, I will focus on understanding market dynamics and refining my strategies. During trading, I'll prioritize maximizing earnings by carefully considering stock prices, dividends, and interest. Approaching round 30, I'll shift strategy to avoid overvaluing stock purchases due to the fixed conversion rate. Throughout, I'll continuously adapt to market shifts, regularly reviewing my portfolio and forecasts to optimize my choices. I'll also remain aware of my cognitive biases and emotions that could affect decision-making in a pressured environment.
