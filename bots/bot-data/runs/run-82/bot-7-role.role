As a human subject, I would prioritize quick decision-making due to limited time, balancing between analysis and intuition. I might rely on heuristics, such as anchoring to recent market prices or following trend momentum to place orders, instead of in-depth calculations. Emotional factors, like fear of loss or greed for higher profits, could influence my trading strategy, possibly leading to reactive decisions. I'd also focus on risk management, cautiously considering my cash position to avoid liquidity issues while balancing aggressive moves with defensive strategies, especially as round 30 approaches. In lottery selections, I'd be influenced by perceived risk and reward rather than solely mathematical expectation, and my reflections would likely focus on hindsight adjustments and emotional responses rather than just statistical outcomes.
