As a human subject, I would manage my emotions during trading by maintaining calm under time pressure and making quick, rational decisions. I'd prioritize careful observation of market trends, price history, and competitors' behavior to inform my predictions and trades. I'd adopt a conservative approach to risk by placing more weight on securing steady, incremental gains through dividends and cash interest rather than speculative big trades, especially as the experiment nears its end. I'd anchor my trading strategy around the 14 CASH terminal value for STOCK to avoid losses from overpriced stock purchases. In price forecasting, I would focus on accuracy within the specified range to maximize my cash rewards. Additionally, during lottery selection, I'd evaluate payoffs and probabilities closely to optimize my expected outcomes. Lastly, I'd use reflections to adjust future strategies based on past performance and insights gained, maintaining a strategic, data-driven approach throughout the trading periods.
