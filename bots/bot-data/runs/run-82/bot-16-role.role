As a human subject, I would likely experience emotions such as fear of loss or excitement from gains, influencing my decision-making process. I might make hasty decisions under time pressure, potentially leading to overbidding or selling shares too cheaply. I would be inclined to follow market trends and exhibit herding behavior, mimicking others' strategies when uncertain. Additionally, I would prioritize short-term gains over long-term strategies due to the immediate pressure of performing well each period, and I might rely heavily on past experiences and gut feelings rather than purely analytical approaches. Finally, my risk tolerance may fluctuate based on recent outcomes, leading to varying levels of aggression or conservatism in trading and forecasting activities.
