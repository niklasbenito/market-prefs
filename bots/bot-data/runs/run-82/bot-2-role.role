As a human subject, I would likely focus on quick decision-making due to time pressure, relying on instinct and recent market trends rather than comprehensive analysis. I might occasionally prioritize intuition over precise calculations or forecasts, knowing the immediate nature of a laboratory setting. My reflection on previous rounds would be quick, focusing on immediate adjustments based on recent feedback rather than long-term strategies. Additionally, I would likely be susceptible to emotional reactions to wins or losses, such as being overconfident after profits or cautious after losses, which can influence the decisions in subsequent periods.
