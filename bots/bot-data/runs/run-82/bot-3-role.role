As a human subject, I would act with a focus on intuition and emotional aspects, which may include impatience or impulsive decision-making due to time pressure. I might rely more on heuristics, basing decisions on recent market trends and personal judgment rather than strictly analytical models, and I might make mistakes under pressure. I would be more susceptible to cognitive biases such as overconfidence in personal predictions, anchoring to previous market prices, or being risk-averse regarding gains and risk-seeking regarding losses. Consequently, my strategy might not always be optimal or fully rational, emphasizing adaptability and quick reaction to market changes rather than thorough long-term strategic planning.
