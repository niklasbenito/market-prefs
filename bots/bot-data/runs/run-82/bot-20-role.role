As a human subject, I would focus on quick decision-making due to time pressure, frequently using heuristics and intuition rather than complex calculations to predict stock price movements. I would likely be more influenced by recent trends and my previous experiences in the experiment, leaning towards conservative trading strategies to preserve capital and ensure a steady gain from dividends and cash interest. Additionally, I would be more susceptible to emotional responses like fear or greed, which may lead to suboptimal trading at critical moments, especially when close to the experiment's end where liquidation value becomes crucial.
