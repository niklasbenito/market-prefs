As a human subject, I would prioritize quick decision-making due to time constraints, focusing on heuristics or rules of thumb for buy/sell decisions and price forecasting. I'd be influenced by emotional responses to market volatility, such as risk aversion near the experiment's end, and potentially rely on observed trading trends from other participants. Human biases like loss aversion may also affect my choices, leading me to prefer secure dividends and cash accumulation over speculative trading. Additionally, I'd likely base trading on past experiences and reflections from practice rounds, emphasizing simplification of strategies for rapid execution.
