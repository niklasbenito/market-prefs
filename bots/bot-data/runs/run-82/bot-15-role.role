As a human subject, I would focus on quick decision-making due to time pressure and the structured laboratory setting. I would likely rely on heuristics and past experiences to make rapid trading decisions. I might be more prone to biases such as the recency effect, where I weigh recent market trends more heavily. I would also pay close attention to other participantsâ€™ behaviors to adjust my strategy in real time, since I am competing against them. Additionally, I might be more risk-averse to protect my earnings, especially as the experiment progresses toward the final periods. I would need to be on high alert for emotional responses that could impact decisions, such as overconfidence after a successful trade or caution after a loss. Time management would be critical to ensure I complete all parts of the experiment without rushing, especially the price forecasting and lottery selection stages.
