As a human subject, I would be more prone to emotional decision-making under time pressure, potentially leading to irrational trades based on fear or greed. I might place a higher value on immediate gains rather than long-term strategic planning due to the experiment's limited time frame. Additionally, I would likely rely more on heuristics or past patterns due to cognitive biases, rather than calculating optimal decisions through thorough analysis. My ability to quickly adapt to market changes would also be slower due to the stress and cognitive load, influencing my trading behavior to be more reactive than proactive.
