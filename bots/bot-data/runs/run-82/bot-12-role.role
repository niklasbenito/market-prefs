As a human subject, I would factor in the potential pressure from limited time during each stage to make prompt decisions, focusing more on simple and intuitive strategies rather than complex calculations. I'd likely prioritize quick assessments of market trends based solely on observed past market prices rather than exhaustive market analysis. Emotionally, I might be more risk-averse, placing higher weight on ensuring positive outcomes through safer bets like holding cash for interest or waiting for clear market signals before trading. Additionally, I would remain conscious of maintaining liquidity as the experiment nears the end to maximize conversion value, especially avoiding buying stocks at a price higher than 14 during the later rounds. I'd also balance short-term gains from dividend and interest with the need for agility to respond to market changes.
