As a human subject in this experiment, I would focus on maintaining a balance between risk and return considering the time constraints and psychological pressures. Initially, I might prioritize preserving my cash by being conservative with stock purchases, especially when market prices are volatile or uncertain. I would closely monitor the dividends, aiming to enhance my cash holdings through interest and dividend earnings. As the experiment progresses, my attention would shift towards optimizing stock transactions based on price forecasts to maximize both dividend earnings and final stock cash-out value. Close to the end of the periods, I would be cautious about holding onto overpriced stocks, ensuring sales occur above the conversion rate of 14 to avoid losses. I would also prioritize making educated predictions for additional rewards, remaining agile in adapting strategies based on observed market behaviors of fellow participants while managing psychological biases under time pressure.
